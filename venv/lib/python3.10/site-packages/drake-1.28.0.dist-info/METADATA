Drake ("dragon" in Middle English) is a toolbox started by the Robot Locomotion
Group at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL).
The development team has now grown significantly, with core development led by
the Toyota Research Institute.
It is a collection of tools for analyzing the dynamics of our robots and
building control systems for them, with a heavy emphasis on optimization-based
design/analysis.

See https://drake.mit.edu/pip.html for installation instructions and caveats.
